#16

16, with 16 cuts on his body,

3 overtly obvious of malicious intent,

2 too deep to look past, a pretend accident.

2 lacking in depth, a singular result of a scuffle with lies.


1, Once in school, on storey number 2, he cried,

his heart too weak to let him properly breathe.

It took two pushes to send him on this journey,

two pushes to end his own life.


That night, he took it as a sign;

he began carving his skin with a broken knife.

First, 2 too shallow, like the ones caused by a scuffle of lies,

followed by 3 deep grooves in the shape of 'Y.'


Now his canvas colored crimson,

he chased the pulse on his skin,

deepening the shade, 

he sated his crave of being crimson.


5 scars we barely know about:

2 from the pretend accident we talked about,

and 3 from the love he sought from his family,

for breaking the rules they never allowed.


People gathered around him after the crimson night,

judged him from the murmurs, 

about what some two lied:

Not brave, not right, they sighed.


They're just scars, just remnants of the past;

even the strands, now pretend,

with him in the middle, 

until the end, he is to blame.


They pretend to see, they pretend to care;

in their eyes, he's just a broken man.

Only people who help themselves get help,

so instead of confronting, they pretend.
